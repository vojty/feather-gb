## Info

This is my first project in Rust, so many patterns might not be ideal. I also wanted to try WebAssembly a little bit.

## Status

The emulator is somehow accurate - the CPU is cycle accurate and the emulator passes many tests, although the PPU's accuracy needs to be improved a lot. For more info see tests results below.

## Test results

The emulator is tested against popular test suites such as [blargg's test](https://github.com/retrio/gb-test-roms), [mooneye's tests](https://github.com/Gekkio/mooneye-gb/) etc.
These test suites are linked as git submodules (see `.gitmodules` file for details).

Generated test report is [here](./docs/results/results.md)

## Modes

The emulator can be run in 2 modes - the normal mode (shows just GameBoy's display) and the debugger mode (using [egui](https://github.com/emilk/egui)). Both are available for the desktop and the browser.

### Desktop

- Standard - rendered by SDL2 (should be cross platform, but I've tested only MacOS)
- Debugger - rendered by egui (using glium as backend)

### Browser

Based on React & TypeScript in general

- Standard - WebAssembly with some stylesheets
- Debugger - WebAssembly with egui (using webgl as backend)

## TODOs

No specific priority here

- standard (play) mode
  - support for custom controls + gamepad
- APU
  - audio + video synchronization
  - channel 4 implementation
- FIFO & Fetcher for sprites
- save & load
- make PPU more accurate
  - pass all [wilbertpol's tests](https://github.com/Amjad50/mooneye-gb)
  - pass some [mealybug-tearoom-tests](https://github.com/mattcurrie/mealybug-tearoom-tests)
- memory bus conflicts
- GameBoy Color support
  - implement HDMA & GDMA
