Just another GameBoy emulator written in Rust ðŸ¦€.

## Modes

The emulator can be run in 2 modes - the normal mode (shows just GameBoy's display) and the debugger mode (using amazing [egui](https://github.com/emilk/egui)). Both are available for the desktop and the browser.

### Desktop

- Standard - **WIP** SDL2 (should be cross platform, but I've tested only MacOS)
- Debugger - egui (glium)

### Browser

Based on React & TypeScript in general

- Standard - **WIP** pure WebAssembly with some stylesheets
- Debugger - WebAssembly with egui
